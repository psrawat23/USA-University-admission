# USA-University-admission
Data analysis and classification done on the USA university admission data

Background information: Every year many thousands of international students get admitted to universities in the United States. We would like to analyse the GRE and GPA scores needed to get admitted to such universities. We have a very popular dataset (which is attached at the end of this document) called university admission dataset. This dataset has GRE score, GPA score, University Prestige and Selection – YES – NO as columns. It will be useful to build a model to predict if a given student will get admission in the university of his choice

Purpose: The purpose of this exercise is to perform a first level of data analysis for the university admission of international students in the United States and to classify selection of those students as “YES” or “NO” 

Problem statement: Please find the attached university_admission.csv file here. Perform simple data analysis and visualization using pandas and sea born libraries. Display using a histogram, bar chart and box plot - details of students selected based on GPA, GRE and prestige of the institution. Show the analysis and visualizations using pandas.groupby and pandas.crosstab functions. Build a prediction model using logistic regression algorithm to predict if the applicant will get admission or not
